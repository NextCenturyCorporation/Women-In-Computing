These are materials for a Minecraft modding activity involving super jump and parachute mods.
This activity is adapted from chapter 5 of "Minecraft Modding with Forge" by Aditya Gupta and 
Arun Gupta.

Assuming a fresh version of Forge is set up in Eclipse, the package structure included here
("org.devoxx4kids.forge.mods.wic") can be dropped directly into the src folder.

"WIC2015_super_jump.docx" contains instructions for the activity.
